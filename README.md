I'm engineering manager in a cloud-native world managing mid-sized cross-functional team and managing cloud-related intiatives at [VirtusLab](http://virtuslab.com/). 

These days I usually build cloud platforms and help with large transformation in area of cloud-native. I'm still actively involved in technical design and programming.

## Competencies

- **Software Engineering** - mostly Go these days, previously Java, Python.
- **Building cloud infrastructures and platforms** - Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Azure, VMWare Tanzu
- **Service Mesh and inter-service communication** - general understanding of concepts and various technologies like Consul Service Mesh and Istio - still someting to expore more.
- **Infrastructure as Code** - quite good experience with doing this at scale, including [inner-sourcing](https://innersourcecommons.org/getting-started/) approach.
- **Monitoring and Incident Management** - open source technologies like Grafana & Prometheus as well as enterprise products like Splunk, Datadog, VMware Weavefront etc.
- **Continuous Integration and Delivery**
- **Establishing support and operations for live systems**

## Notable Work

- Built self-hosted production-ready Kubernetes distribution based mostly on CoreOS stack on AWS. Full lifecycle-management with immutable infrastructure using CloudFormation, Bash, cloud-init and Container Linux.
- Designed, built and supported container as a service platform based on self-hosted Kubernetes on AWS. The platform was hosting bussiness-critical services for 3+ years until managed Kubernetes became mainstream.
- Responsible for Kubernetes infrastructure standards, best practices and infrastructure as code written in Terraform within large organization (200+ devs).
- Successful inner-sourcing initiative in area of cloud infrastructures, mainly in Azure. Built an active community and contribution model.
- From small OSS project to a fully-fledged product in public cloud - design, product strategy, roadmap and engineering team building&upskilling.

## Writing

- You can find some of my blog posts on [medium.com/@antoniaklja](medium.com/@antoniaklja). I'm wring mostly on software enginering, management and cloud-native technologies. 
- Also random rambling on Twitter [ @antoniaklja](https://twitter.com/antoniaklja).

## Open Source

- [crypt](https://github.com/VirtusLab/crypt) & [render](https://github.com/VirtusLab/render) - cloud CLI tooling written mostly in Go.
- [jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator) - Kubernetes operator written in Go.
- [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) - some minor contribiution :)
